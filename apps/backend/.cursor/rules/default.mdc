# Rules

- never use `.then()`. Always use normal promises,
- do not put comments in the code,
- enums keys are in `ThisCase`. Enum values are in `thisCase`,
- dtos used for submodules (not for controllers) have file names in this format `some-update.dto.ts`. Class names are in this format `SomeUpdateDto`. Do not put validation in these DTOs,
- dtos used in core module in controller have proper sufix like `UpdateXBody`, `UpdateXQuery`. If response in custom it is defined as `UpdateXResponse`,
- always use private/public when defining class methods,
