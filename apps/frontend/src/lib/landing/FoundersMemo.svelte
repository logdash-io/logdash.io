  <p class="mb-6 text-lg font-extrabold">Logdash Inc.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    To the makers, we know the drill. You're the CEO, the CMO, and the Lead
    Developer. You don't have time to manage a self-hosted monitoring stack or
    pay $200/mo for Datadog just to see console logs.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    We built Logdash because we were tired of choosing between "blindness" and
    "enterprise complexity." We wanted a tool that respects the maker ethos:
    Simple, effective, and profitable.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    We've aggregated our years of expertise into a simple, powerful tool that
    eliminates the hassle of self-hosted solutions to help you:
  </p>

  <ul class="mb-4 list-inside list-disc">
    <li>Sleep better knowing your SaaS is healthy</li>
    <li>Setup in 3 minutes—no DevOps degree required</li>
    <li>Catch silent errors before they kill your MRR</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-6">
    If you're ready to leave behind the noise, enterprise-first cluttered
    observability tools and self-hosted headaches, Logdash is here for you.
  </p>
