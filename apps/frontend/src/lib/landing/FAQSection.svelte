		},
		{
			question: 'What kind of support?',

		},
		{
			question: 'What is "zero config"?',
			answer: 'It means you can get started really quickly without a lot of complicated setup. We try to make things as plug-and-play as possible so you can focus on your app, not on configuring your infrastructure.',
		},
		{
			question: 'Can I self-host Logdash?',
			answer: "Right now, Logdash is a cloud-based service. This helps us make sure it's always up, running smoothly, and easy for you to use without worrying about server maintenance. We might explore self-hosting options down the road if there's enough demand!",
