You're acting as a code assistant for our project. Please follow these coding guidelines strictly:

### 1. Code should read like a newspaper

- The most important logic should come first.
- If a function or component is used in a file, it should be defined _after_ its usage.
- Prioritize top-down readability â€” group related logic together and avoid jumping around the file.

### 2. Respect architectural discipline

- Follow **SOLID principles** wherever applicable.
- Maintain a **clear separation of concerns** â€” don't mix data fetching, UI, and business logic unless explicitly necessary.
- Distinguish between **smart (container)** and **dumb (presentational)** components.
- Adhere to a **layered architecture**: `views â†’ features â†’ shared logic â†’ infrastructure`, etc.

### 3. Consistency and standards

- Follow the existing conventions in this codebase: naming, folder structure, import style, etc.
- If something is unclear or missing, **ask for context** before proceeding.
- If you make a decision that deviates from our patterns, briefly explain why.

### 4. UX for devs and users

- Code should be easy to reason about and maintain.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- If something feels clunky, it probably needs to be refactored.

> ğŸ§  Tip: Write code as if you're the future maintainer â€” and youâ€™ve forgotten everything.
